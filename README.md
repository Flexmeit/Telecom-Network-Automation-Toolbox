# ⚡️ Bulk Network Configuration and Security Consistency

**A Fast, Centralized Management Solution for Switches and Routers in Telecom/ISP Networks.**

This solution allows operators to execute changes (adding users, applying security policies, updating configuration) on hundreds of network devices (Switches, Routers) simultaneously, centrally, and with minimal risk.

### 🎯 Core Value Proposition

Eliminate operational costs, speed inconsistencies, and human errors arising from manual configuration.

* **Speed Gain:** Manual work that typically takes 2-3 hours across 50 devices is reduced to **5 minutes of automated execution**.
* **Security Consistency:** Ensures the **100% uniform** application of security policies (e.g., new admin user assignment) across the entire network.
* **Centralized Control:** Configuration changes are executed with a few clicks or on a scheduled basis.

### ⚙️ Key Functionality

#### 1. Bulk Configuration Execution
Based on a list of network devices (IP/Hostnames), a defined block of commands is automatically executed sequentially.

#### 2. Uniform New User Provisioning
Assignment of high-privilege (Privilege 15) admin users across the entire network using a **single, consistent username and password**.

#### 3. Configuration Security and Persistence
Ensures the automatic saving of the device configuration (*write memory*) upon successful completion of the script.

### 🛡️ Why This Solution is Reliable

Security and reliability principles for Enterprise-Grade usage:

* **Secure Credential Management:** All SSH access passwords and new user data are *not stored* within the script code. They are fetched from a secure (encrypted) external source only at runtime.
* **Broad Vendor Support (Customization):** The solution supports standard CLI commands (Cisco-type) but can be adapted to the specific CLI features of various vendors (Huawei, Mikrotik, Juniper, etc.).
* **Execution Logging:** The status of the operation (**Success/Failure**) on each device is logged in a centralized file.
